    <section>
      <p><strong>Hello! I am Francesco Gazzola.</strong>
        <p>I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and during my studies I have found out that the aspect about computer science that interests
            me more is the emerging field of the artificial intelligence (AI). I bumb into AI by joining an hackathon where we were asked to come up with a voice-based application.
            Later, I could going deeper into it by attending some courses offered by the university. Moreover, I took advantage of my bachelor's thesis to look into some AI topics by choosing
            as main topic the Spoken Language Understanding (SLU).
            <p>Regarding myself, I am hard working individual, quite responsible focused to meet deadlines.
            I enjoy perfectionism and I therefore pay attention to cure every single detail in my work. I
            tend not to take anything for granted and so perform on exams and other university activities
            as best as I can. I am willing to learn in a changing and challenging environment to grow both as person and as professional.</p>

          <p>I took part in a hackathon, which was offered by a company manufacturing technological
              ovens. The project aimed at realizing an intelligent algorithm to manage
              an oven by the speech recognition. To achieve this, I collaborated with a team
              composed of four guys who had different backgrounds from mine: one was a business
              student and the others studied physics. The main aim was to come up with
              the algorithm, but we also had to take into account the user experience and the
              choice of hardware, trying to minimize the costs.</p>

        <div class="descrition">
          <p>In May 2017 I could take part in a free European programme, whose aim was to
              provide us some knowledge about industrial automation. I learnt how to make
              use of Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 with the usage of some sensors. In particular,
              this course aimed at teaching how to use sensors and microcontrollers to acquire
              some information, and then to elaborate it.
              All the participants and I built a simple temperature sensor feedback network to
              monitor the temperature of a room: once acquired it, it was sent by Wi-Fi to
              a Raspberry microcontroller to elaborate it and to save it in a MySQL database.
              The elaboration consisted in giving error if the temperature was below or above a
              certain value.
              At the end of the course, each of us had to do a real project for a factory, whose
              goal was to use sensors and microcontroller to monitor their production (e.g. counting
              the manufactured products, duration of the production, chronology of the
              manufactured products every day and so on).</p>

          <p> As I came back from the erasmus at Copenhagen I decided to join the non profit association
              ESN Padua. The organisation deals with welcoming foreign students in Italy and is mainly composed by students
              who have had abroad experiences either for study or work reasons. <br>
              I decided to join to meet new people and hear their abroad experiences. Later I could join the marketing, graphics and
              communication team, in which I deal with designing template for the social network platform to promote partners discounts and events.
              This lets me the opportunity to give voice to my immagination and creativity.
